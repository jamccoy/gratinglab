"""The Qt widget layer.

Thin on purpose, like its Tk predecessor was: the logic worth testing lives in
``gui/state.py``, ``gui/provenance.py``, ``gui/richtext.py`` and
``gui/orders.py``, all of which are pure and tested headlessly. What is checked
here is the wiring -- and above all that the window is not a second source of
truth: whatever it plots must equal what the core produces for the same inputs.

Unlike the Tk suite this replaces, these tests need no display. ``conftest.py``
sets ``QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen``, under which a window always constructs, so
they run on every CI job rather than only on macOS.
